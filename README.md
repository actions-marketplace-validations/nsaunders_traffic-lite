# Traffic Lite

This GitHub Action offers a simple way to preserve your repository's traffic data beyond the usual [14-day limit](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/399). It uses the [Repository traffic API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/metrics/traffic?apiVersion=2022-11-28) to capture clones and views, logging the results in JSON format to a file of your choosing.
